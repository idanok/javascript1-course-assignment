            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>We are a group of good friends who always
                wanted to make good and sustainable jackets
                for our outdoor adventures. We share a lot of
                interests, such as: hiking, rafting, skiing, camping,
                canoeing and exploring nature. Outdoor clothing is
                therefor very important to us and we are passionate
                about sharing our products with the world for a better
                outdoor experience. The environment is something we
                all really cares about and we always had a goal to make
                the jackets as sustainable as possible.

        <h2>OUR FOCUS</h2>
        <p>Fast fashion is growing faster then ever and comes
            with an astonishing environmental and social cost.
            We in Rainydays are therefor committed to making
            the jackets as sustainable as possible. The material
            is made out of recycled materials and uses biodegradable
            components from recycled fibers. These materials grow
            with no pesticide or fertilizer, consume less energy
            and water, and employ no chemical treatment, thus reducing
            the overall carbon footprint. We also use fabrics that
            specializes in sustainable clothes. These fabrics are
            also local so that we can meet with the producer without
            having to travel by plane. We are determent to do what we
            can for a more sustainable world.
